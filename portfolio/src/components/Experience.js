                    I have worked two part-time jobs where I learned the importance of time management and how to 
                    balance my work and student life. Through taking an Intemediate Software Engineering course in 
                    my third year. As part of the course, I led a team of six in developing an e-commerce website 
                    for our term project. I managed my team effectively, ensuring that tasks were delegated
